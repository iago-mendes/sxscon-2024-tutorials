While a number of strategies have been proposed in the literature, our experience has been that these are not generally robust enough for scientific applications. Instead, we supplement a DG method with a FD in regions where there are shocks. This allows us to gain the shock capturing capabilities of FD methods, which have a decades-long and rich history of development, with high-order accuracy and efficiency in smooth regions. You've already learned about DG methods, so we will briefly review FD methods and then discuss how we couple DG and FD together.\n",

Multi-dimensional numerical fluxes are very much still in their infancy as a research topic in applied maths."

That is, anything that is underresolved effectively appears as a discontinuity ond so cannot be accurately represented using a spectral method like DG.\n",

    "What we observe is an unphysical ringing in the solution known as Gibbs phenomenon. This shows that the DG solution doesn't represent step functions accurately. Looking back at the plot of the spectral modes, this is also visible from the spectral modes not decaying exponentially. The higher modes are very oscillatory and so should be small corrections to the solutions. Since they aren't here, we see very poor interpolation. What this tells us is that we need to interpolate to the FD grid **before** any discontinuities enter our DG element.\n",

That is, $\\mathcal{R}(\\mathcal{P})=\\mathcal{I}$ where $\\mathcal{I}$ is the identity. Ultimately this is achieved by having $\\mathcal{R}$ be the pseudo-inverse of $\\mathcal{P}$ computed from a constrained linear least squares problem where the constraint is that the integral over the FD grid and DG grid are the same. Deriving the $\\mathcal{R}$ operator/matrix is quite involved(https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11645).

    "The first test problem we will look at is called the Sod shock tube. This is a standard test problem in Newtonian hydrodynamics where a rarefaction waves travels leftward while a shock and contact discontiunity travel to the right. Below we plot the density as blue dots and the pressure as orange triangles. While this is not a particularly challenging test problem, it nicely shows the hybrid method switching between DG and FD. In this case we use the HLL (Harten-Lax-van Leer) approximate Riemann solver, which is commonly used in numerical relativity applications."
